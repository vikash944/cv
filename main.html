        <h3>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</h3>
        <hr>
        <blockquote>October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an 
            Indian aerospace scientist and statesman 
            who served as the 11th President of India 
            from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised 
            in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace 
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist 
            and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
             Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research 
             Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's 
             civilian space programme and military missile development 
             efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of 
            India for his work on the development of ballistic missile 
            and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal 
            organisational, technical, and political role in India's 
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,<mark>&lt; the first since the 
                original nuclear test by India in 1974.&gt;</mark> <br>

        <p><blockquote> After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 
            1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment
            of the Defence Research and Development Organisation 
            (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as 
            a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research
             & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by 
             designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced 
             by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam was also part
              of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai,
              the renowned space scientist.[13] In 1969, Kalam was 
              transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation 
              (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's 
              first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which 
              successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in 
              near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first 
              started work on an expandable rocket project 
              independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, 
              Kalam received the government's approval 
              and expanded the programme to include more
               engineers</blockquote></p>
